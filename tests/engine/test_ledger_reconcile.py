"""``LedgerReconciliation`` — the account-grain cycle that classifies and heals
nothing (issue #193).

Exercised through its public verbs against a **live**-shaped ledger over an
in-memory store and a venue double answering recorded account snapshots. The
venue is doubled because it is a process boundary (ADR-0022) and it is the only
thing doubled here: the ledger, its store and its clock are the real ones, so a
case asserts what the cycle *concludes* about a book a fill actually moved.
